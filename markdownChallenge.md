# Markdown Challenge

## This is MY Markdown! ðŸ‘‡

### A little about myself!

Hello and welcome to my Markdown challenge. I'm Kailana and I have a very broad range of hobbies and interests. Specifically in my tech interests, I enjoy learning about networking and how information flows throughout the internet. I also enjoy fooling around with penetration testing (using sites designed to be infiltrated of course).

I am interested in IT management specifically focused on the management of security. I hope to gain experience one day as an IT specialist then work up to to Network Admin, then ISSO (Info Sys Sec Officer). Eventually, I would hope to earn a position as CISO (Chief Info Sec Officer). I also would like to start my own IT consulting firm here on Maui one day.
