# Why should you participate in ceramics?
[**Pottery**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery), one of the oldest human crafts dating back to around 29,000 BCE, began as a necessity for creating durable containers but evolved into a significant cultural and artistic endeavor. Over time, it became a medium for artistic expression and cultural storytelling, with civilizations like the Greeks and Chinese developing renowned techniques and designs. Today, pottery blends functionality with beauty and remains a vital part of cultural heritage and artistic practice.
## Benefits
### Mental Health
- Stress Relief: Creating art and pottery can be very relaxing, helping to reduce stress and anxiety.
- Mindfulness: Focusing on the creative process helps cultivate mindfulness, and encourages being present in the moment.
- Emotional Expression: Art provides a medium to express emotions and thoughts that might be difficult to verbalize.
 - Mental Stimulation: Art stimulates the brain, encouraging problem-solving and innovative thinking.
### Physical Health 
1. Fine Motor Skills: Working with clay and other materials enhances fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination.

2. Hand Strength: Kneading and shaping clay can strengthen hand muscles and improve dexterity.

3. Sensory Experience: The tactile experience of working with different textures and materials can be very soothing and engaging.
### Cognitive Benefits
| Benefits               | Cost      |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Creativity Boost       | Priceless |
| Problem-Solving Skills | Priceless |
| Memory Enhancement     | Priceless |
### Educational Benefits 
>"Shaping clay with our hands teaches our children to be nimble and strong, vital for daily tasks and survival. Crafting pots and vessels stirs our minds, making us think creatively and solve problems as we shape and decorate. Through pottery, we share and preserve our tribe's stories and traditions, passing wisdom from one generation to the next." - ***ChatGPT on pottery, as if it were from 29,000 BCE***

# Why Matcha is Good for the SOUL

## It's a great substitute for drinking coffee.

### It's rich in antioxidants!

I love to make matcha at home. I use ceremonial grade matcha from Kyoto, Japan using a bamboo whisk to get all those earthy and nutty notes from the matcha powder. And no, matcha does not taste like grass. If you think it tastes like grass, you have not encompassed the beauty of good matcha. Shame shame.

Gabi's Matcha Recipe:
Ingredients:

- 1 tbsp Ceremonial Grade Matcha (preferred)
- A gorgeous and aesthetic 8oz glass cup
- Some ice
- Almond milk (or other milk of your choice, almond tends to not overpower the matcha)
- honey or any sweetener of your liking
- A strainer
- A small bowl
- Bamboo whisk or electric frother (I like to use a bamboo whisk because it makes me think it tastes better)
- Hot water (about 175 F)
- A pretty glass straw

1. In a bowl, sift 1 tbsp of matcha using a strainer.
2. Add hot water till about 1/3 of the bowl. Make sure you're using a small bowl, I personally did not think of measuring the amount of water I use. Whoops.
3. Whisk matcha with bamboo whisk in a "W" shaped motion, being sure not to hit the base of the bowl. Add sweetener (honey for ex). Mix well.
4. Add some ice cubes in a glass cup and pour milk till about 3/4 of the cup.
5. Add whisked matcha/honey into glass containing almond milk.
6. Add glass straw and enjoy.

### Buy Matcha Here:

Very affordable. I buy the 200g can of Aoarashi since it's the cheapest, but I recently bought Yugen and have been enjoying it a lot. Sorry it's all sold out currently but definitely recommend!

> One day, my dream is to move to Kyoto, Japan and start a matcha farm.

`const matcha = {
    isTheBest: true;
}

| Matcha     | Coffee             |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| the GOAT   | Gives you anxiety  |
| Energizing | Tastes good though |

_With all that said, I still actually drink 4 shots of espresso daily. And matcha. :D_

# About Me (balderekjk)

## Background (balderekjk)

I am Maui raised not born, born of Colorado, early childhood in Illinois, since 11 been here with Maui family. Went to Kamehameha Maui, WSU, UH Maui, then UH Manoa where I graduated with BA in Anthropology.

## Interests (balderekjk)

I guess I like to find simple ways to get things up quickly. I am quite a fan of markdown (and the community who made these terrifically efficient markdown processors to load it in the web).

Markdown also looks very nice by itself, even saved as a .txt file.

Recently I've been exploring Astro on my own time. It is a sweet meta-framework, great for sites that are primarily static but need some parts interactive. ".astro" files are basically just superpowered html with frontmatter and scoped css. Also gives ability to write pages in markdown, extended markdown, and other markdown flavors.

I enjoy books but have been in a reading rut for the last two years. I highly recommend Kurt Vonnegut's "Welcome to the Monkey House," for a collection of insightful and amusing short stories.

## Random Hawaii Resources (balderekjk)

I was quite inspired by today's meeting. I want to share some recs to stay in the loop. I know more-so Maui resources at the moment...

1. Maui Techies Group Meetups

   They meet every 4th Monday of the month. People, old and new gather together. Fanstastic networking opportunity.

   - [Meetup link](https://www.meetup.com/maui-techies-meetup/)
   - [Hawaiitech link](https://events.hawaiitech.com/event/maui-techies-meetup-at-maui-brewing-company-6-24-2024/)
   - [Facebook link](https://www.facebook.com/groups/404808369670064/)

   An aside, there are some members of Maui Techies who come out for Wednesday runs at Kalama Park (run starts at 5:30pm, meet by volleyball net).

2. Hawaii Slack (and Hawaii Discord)

   I was made aware of this channel by a Maui Techies member.

   A slack dedicated to building community opportunities, including tech. Both Oahu and Maui. Join and keep tabs. There are two sub-channels for seeking and recruiting jobs.

   Their sister site is Hawaii Discord.

   Hawaii Discord Coda:

   > Hawaii Discord (and its sister site Hawaii Slack) is part of the [Hawaii Hui](https://www.hawaiihui.com/). Founded in 1994 by Ryan Kawailani Ozawa, Hawaii Hui LLC (formerly Leahi.Net) is the largest and longest-running blog network and online publishing group in the Aloha State.

   - [Slack invite link](https://hawaii.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-lvudhfgm-65TFeCxlcNs2wWqHMTUVtg)
   - [Discord info link](https://www.hawaiidiscord.com/)
   - [Discord invite link](https://discord.gg/egR2m6Tp76)

3. Hawaii Hackathon

   A great opportunity to collaborate with inspired innovators and network.

   - [Official link](https://hacc.hawaii.gov/)

4. Code Block

   Code blocks are sweet. After the opening three backticks ` ``` `, specify your language `javascript` like:

   > \```javascript  
   function HelloARL() {  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;console.log('ARL Oahu and Maui are awesome and supportive.');  
   }  
   HelloARL();  
   \```

   The above will render like:

   ```javascript
   function HelloARL() {
     console.log('ARL Oahu and Maui are awesome and supportive.');
   }
   HelloARL();
   ```

5. Tables (balderekjk)

   |Tables|are|fun|
   |:---:|:---|---:|
   |I am centered|I am left|I am right|

6. Surprise Me! (balderekjk)

   Here's a footnote. Don't give up hope[^1].
