# Why Matcha is Good for the SOUL

## It's a great substitute for drinking coffee.

### It's rich in antioxidants!

I love to make matcha at home. I use ceremonial grade matcha from Kyoto, Japan using a bamboo whisk to get all those earthy and nutty notes from the matcha powder. And no, matcha does not taste like grass. If you think it tastes like grass, you have not encompassed the beauty of good matcha. Shame shame.

Gabi's Matcha Recipe:
Ingredients:

- 1 tbsp Ceremonial Grade Matcha (preferred)
- A gorgeous and aesthetic 8oz glass cup
- Some ice
- Almond milk (or other milk of your choice, almond tends to not overpower the matcha)
- honey or any sweetener of your liking
- A strainer
- A small bowl
- Bamboo whisk or electric frother (I like to use a bamboo whisk because it makes me think it tastes better)
- Hot water (about 175 F)
- A pretty glass straw

1. In a bowl, sift 1 tbsp of matcha using a strainer.
2. Add hot water till about 1/3 of the bowl. Make sure you're using a small bowl, I personally did not think of measuring the amount of water I use. Whoops.
3. Whisk matcha with bamboo whisk in a "W" shaped motion, being sure not to hit the base of the bowl. Add sweetener (honey for ex). Mix well.
4. Add some ice cubes in a glass cup and pour milk till about 3/4 of the cup.
5. Add whisked matcha/honey into glass containing almond milk.
6. Add glass straw and enjoy.

### Buy Matcha Here:

Very affordable. I buy the 200g can of Aoarashi since it's the cheapest, but I recently bought Yugen and have been enjoying it a lot. Sorry it's all sold out currently but definitely recommend!

| Matcha     | Coffee             |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| the GOAT   | Gives you anxiety  |
| Energizing | Tastes good though |

_With all that said, I still actually drink 4 shots of espresso daily. And matcha. :D_
