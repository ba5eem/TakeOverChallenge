## Why I Love This Aesthetic? 😍

I was born into this aesthetic and grew up with it. It gives off a nostaglic feeling to the 2000s babies like me (2001), and it encompasses most of my childhood. I grew up using Windows XP, was an owner of an iPod at one point, and was entranced with technology at that time - and even now!

### What Is It Exactly? 🤔

Frutiger Aero is a visual aesthetic that emerged in the mid-2000s and is characterized by its sleek, clean, and somewhat futuristic look. It takes its name from the Swiss typeface designer Adrian Frutiger and the "Aero" design elements, which convey a sense of modernity and airiness.

Most imagery had these objects in mind:
- Technology
- Nature-inpsired elements
- 3D viuals or vectors
- Lighting effects

### Who Was Using This Aesthetic? 👩‍💻

1. Windows
2. Apple
3. Software Companies
4. Gaming Industry
5. Web Designers

> Technology companies often used Frutiger Aero elements in their marketing materials to convey innovation and sophistication.
