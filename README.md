# Cody's Markdown

## Cody Cody

### Cody Cody Cody

I like to watch baseball, and I follow the Los Angeles Angels (_Anaheim Angels_). They are what you consider a "poverty franchise", meaning they do not have much success in the
regular season or post-season. They currently have a young group of players that can hopefully help the organization win more games in the future.

Ordered List:

1. Apples
2. Oranges
3. Bananas

Unordered List:

- Chicken
- Cow
- Pig

Here's a quote:

Code block:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

Here's a table:

| Good | Bad |
| Best | Worse |

Here's something cool I found (task lists):
